## Getting Started

This is a Scouting app called FRC Scout which can be used for the FIRST robotics competition or FRC. This is only applicable to the 2025 season right now (Reefscape) and only works on certain formats of your laptop

Some features: 
- Main screen , Scouting Screen and Data screen
- Sheet with all of your previous data (sort of buggy)
- Main screen with buttons and type-able features

I made this project to test my java abilities(especially working with GUIs seriously for the first time) while working on something relating to another extracurricular I loved. I also made it to make fun of my team since we used paper and pen scouting this year and I thought the irony would be funny lol

This is one of my first projects for athena and one of my first "real" coding projects. This project was done in java using JFrame and with alot of blood sweat and tears.

I learned so so sooo much from this project. Mostly learning alot about Java Swing itself and how to troubleshoot my 60 million issues as well as finding out which methods worked and which methods didn't. I also learned alot about arrays and general coding logic structures from this too and I applied everything I learned in my previous cs class (ICS3U) onto this project. I struggled alot with Java Swing itself and i've come a super long way as if you look at my first commits I barely knew how to switch screens. Through this I also learned a LOT about github and git itself. I initialy didn't even know how to properly commit on git so basically what I did for the first 2/3 of the commits in this project was basically I re-uploaded EVERY single file back into the github repo on web so that it would override. Through watching actual github tutorials I eventually found more conventional methods like actual git. (sorry for the long paragraph)






## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
